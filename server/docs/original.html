<h1>ABSTRACT </h1>
<p class="plain-text">While vaccines directed against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein will have varying degrees of
  effectiveness in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infections, the severity of infection will be determined by multiple host
  factors including the ability of immune cells to lyse virus infected cells. This review will discuss the complexity of
  both adaptive and innate immunomes and how a flow-based assay can detect up to 158 distinct cell subsets in the
  periphery. This assay has been employed to show the effect of age on differences in specific immune cell subsets, and
  the differences in the immunome between healthy donors and age-matched cancer patients. Also reviewed are the numerous
  soluble factors, in addition to cytokines, that may vary in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infections and may also be
  employed to help define the effectiveness of a given vaccine or other anti-viral agents. Various steroids have been
  employed in the management of autoimmune adverse events in cancer patients receiving immunotherapeutics and may be
  employed in the management of SARS-CoV-2 infections. The influence of steroids on multiple immune cells subsets will
  also be discussed.</p>
<p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has affected every aspect of the population, including different age groups and patients with
  cancer. It is generally believed that preventive vaccines that will elicit antibody responses to the SARS-CoV-2 agent
  will greatly reduce the percentage of the population that becomes infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. In addition,
  anti-virals, passive administration of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, and other agents such as steroids may lead to
  greater control of the disease. At this time little is known about the effectiveness of the various anti- SARS-CoV-2
  vaccine platforms being developed and administered, especially in terms of the induction of long-term immunity,
  reduction of severity of the disease, protection of SARS-CoV-2 variants that may arise, and toxicities. </p>
<p>One aspect of the control of the COVID-19 pandemic that has received limited attention is the role of the cellular
  immunome in apparently healthy individuals of different age groups, as well as in patients with cancer. It is quite
  possible that variations in the cellular immunome among individuals and among patients with different types and stages
  of cancer may well be a factor in (a) susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection, (b) reduction of the severity of the
  infection, (c) determination of long-term immunity, (d) adverse events in the use of steroids, anti-virals, or other
  agents to control the SARS-CoV-2 infection, and (e) control of SARS-CoV-2 variants that may arise.</p>
<p>Most anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccines being developed consist of the spike protein, or RNA or DNA, reflecting the sequence of
  that protein. Clinical trials are demonstrating the production of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 and, in some cases, T-cell
  responses to the spike protein. While antibody responses to the virus will reduce or prevent infection, it is the
  cellular immunome response to the agent that is necessary to lyse viral-infected cells and thus limit the severity of
  the disease. Thus, in addition to the development of vaccines directed against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, vaccine
  platforms should also be developed consisting of proteins, RNA or DNA reflecting other structural components of the
  SARS-CoV-2 agent. The generation of T-cell responses to these components will thus enable the recognition of
  MHC-peptide complexes of degradation and transport of these components to the surface of infected cells, resulting in
  lysis. If the SARS-CoV-2 agent is similar to other RNA viruses, in contrast to more stable internal structural
  proteins, most variants will be the reflection of changes in the spike or external protein, thus potentially limiting
  the effectiveness of vaccines directed only to that protein. The use of vaccines that elicit T-cell responses to
  multiple SARS-CoV-2 components may thus limit the severity of infections of such variants.</p>
<p>SARS-CoV-2 is comprised of four major structural elements: the transmembrane spike (S) glycoprotein that permits host
  cell entry by binding the human ACE2 receptor, a nucleocapsid (N) protein that facilitates viral replication, membrane
  (M) proteins, and small envelope (E) proteins.<sup>1 2</sup> In individuals with active COVID-19 infection and in
  those in convalescent phases, CD4+ and CD8+ responses against SARS-CoV-2 proteins have been documented. In recovered
  patients, S-specific CD4+ T cells with an activated phenotype and CD8+ T cells expressing markers of cytotoxicity have
  been described.<sup>3</sup> <a id="_Hlk59435855"></a>Predominantly, S-reactive CD4+ T cells are present in most
  patients with active and acute disease.<sup>4 5</sup> Nearly all patients who have recovered from COVID-19 infection
  harbor CD4+ and CD8+ T cells that also recognize multiple regions of the N protein.<sup>6</sup> In fact, very recent
  studies have shown that CD8+ T cells in particular largely recognize epitopes outside of the S protein, and T cells
  recognizing N protein are higher in frequency than T cells against S and other non-structural proteins after
  infection.<sup>7 8</sup> In acute phase patients, it has been shown that specifically N-specific T cells skew towards
  a Th1 phenotype.<sup>9</sup></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Clinical data emerging thus far from trials with different vaccines have demonstrated differential induction of CD4+
  and/or CD8+ responses against the receptor binding domain and other regions spanning the S protein; some of these
  immune responses have showed Th1 polarization with high IFNγ and TNFα production and limited IL-4 and IL-10
  release.<sup>10-12</sup> A vaccine platform targeting both the S and N proteins of the SARS-CoV-2 virus may be
  optimal. Recent preclinical work investigating an hAd5 vector encoding both S and N proteins in mice demonstrated that
  this vaccine construct elicited strong Th1 cellular and neutralizing humoral responses after prime boost, with CD4+
  and CD8+ responses against both S and N epitopes.<sup>13</sup></p>
<p>Immunotherapy is now playing a major role in the management of many cancer types. The mode of action of the vast
  majority of these immunotherapeutics is on multiple components of both the innate and adaptive cellular compartments,
  both in the periphery and in the tumor microenvironment. Thus, a concern will be the influence of the use of
  anti-checkpoint monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), cytokines, anti-cancer vaccines, cellular therapies, or steroids to
  reduce autoimmune adverse events, on susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or severity of that infection.</p>
<p class="plain-text">As a consequence of the renaissance of cancer immunotherapy in recent years, there has been a much
  greater understanding of the human cellular immunome, especially in the complexities involving the interactions among
  and between different components of both the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system. To date, over 150
  different phenotypes of human immune cells have been identified; these are traditionally characterized as the
  so-called “parental” cell types: CD8+, CD4+, natural killer (NK), NK T cells, regulatory CD4+<sup> </sup>T cells
  (Tregs), conventional (c) dendritic cells (cDCs), plasmacytoid (p) DCs, myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), and
  monocytes. For each of these parental cell types, multiple refined subtypes have been identified, many of which have
  defined activation and/or suppressive functions (see Table 1).</p>
<p><strong>ASSAY OF IMMUNE CELL SUBSETS</strong></p>
<p>Multiple types of assays are employed to characterize human immune cells.<sup>14-16</sup> Investigators at the
  National Cancer Institute have employed a flow cytometry‒based assay that requires 5 x 10<sup>6</sup> PBMCs, usually
  obtained from one tube of blood. The assay interrogates the multiple components of both the innate and adaptive immune
  systems seen in Table 1. After processing, cells are frozen and stored so that analyses of a given individual’s
  peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) obtained at different times can be assayed under identical conditions. The
  materials and methods used in this assay have been previously described in detail.<sup>17 18</sup> Multiple prior
  studies have employed the 123-subset assay<sup>19-26</sup> (supplemental table S1). However, additional immune cell
  subsets have recently been identified as having biologic functions. The most recent assay being employed now includes
  analyses of 158 immune cell subsets (table 1). </p>
<p><strong>AGE AND IMMUNE SUBSETS</strong></p>
<p>One observation that is emerging in the COVID-19 pandemic is differences in the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection
  among different age groups. A prior study<sup>18</sup> using the assay described defined differences in the immunome
  in apparently healthy individuals who are less than 40 years of age versus those older than 40 years; this arbitrary
  distinction was made because cancer incidence greatly increases in individuals over 40 years old. Figure 1A shows the
  ages of the two groups from which PBMCs were analyzed. This prior study<sup>18</sup> showed higher levels of absolute
  lymphocyte counts in individuals less than 40 years vs those older than 40 years.<strong> </strong>Figure 1B and C
  reveal that individuals older than 40 have higher levels of NK cells, but, in contrast, have lower levels of CD8+ T
  cells. This observation is extended when one analyzes more refined subsets, with examples of differences in individual
  subsets shown in Figure 1D-I involving specific subtypes of CD8 T cells and B cells. While most CD8+ refined subsets
  do not differ with age, it appears that apparently healthy individuals over 40 have lower levels of CD8+ T cells with
  potential suppressive properties (figure 1D-F). Figure 2 shows a heat map depicting the gradient in changes of immune
  cell subsets observed with age (18-78 years); as seen, NK cells increase with age, while CD8 T cells decrease. This
  gradient is also seen with the different refined subsets of CD8+ T cells and B cells. </p>
<p>Severe SARS-CoV-2 infection is characterized by lymphopenia, with reduced CD8+ T cells associated with higher levels
  of ICU admission and decreased survival.<sup>27 </sup>Remaining CD8+ cells express higher levels of exhaustion markers
  such as PD-1, Tim-3, and CTLA-4 with increasing disease severity.<sup>28 29 </sup>The lower levels of CD8+ T cells
  seen in older individuals along with the increased prevalence of suppressive markers echoes the immune subset picture
  seen in severe COVID-19. This may begin to explain the older population’s higher risk of morbidity and mortality with
  this disease: the decreased number and effector function of CD8+ subsets at baseline would suggest impaired antiviral
  immunity and decreased capacity for viral clearance. As for the higher levels of NK cells in older age groups, one
  might expect that this would support a more robust antiviral response in COVID-19. However, NK cells are also
  negatively impacted by the lymphopenia seen with COVID-19, and preliminary data suggest that remaining cells either
  develop an exhausted phenotype or traffic to the lungs where they may contribute to inflammatory
  damage.<strong><sup>30 </sup></strong>The more severe illness seen in older patients, including the potential for
  greater inflammatory lung injury, may be due to one or more factors, including higher levels of NK cells, macrophages
  or TH17-driven phenomenon. This will clearly be the focus of future investigations.<strong> </strong>There are too few
  subjects in the presented datasets to draw reliable conclusions or correlations from a racial subgroup analysis.
  However, this would be a critical area for future study in larger populations.</p>
<p><strong>IMMUNOME DIFFERENCES BETWEEN CANCER PATIENTS AND APPARENTLY HEALTHY DONORS</strong></p>
<p>Studies have also been conducted<sup>18</sup> to see if differences exist between apparently healthy donors and
  age-matched patients with a range of different cancers (figure 3A; supplemental tables S2 and S3). While there was no
  difference in absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) between the two age-matched groups, clear differences were seen in
  CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and B cells (figure 3B,C), but not in the other major parental subsets. More profound
  differences were seen with the analyses of some, but not all, refined CD8 subsets; in particular, age-matched cancer
  patients had much higher levels of CD8+ T cells with a suppressive phenotype (figure 3E,F). Notably, age-matched
  cancer patients had much higher levels of Tregs with a suppressive phenotype (figure 3G), and higher levels of
  specific MDSCs (figure 3H,I). Changes were also noted in specific, but not all, refined B cell subsets; B cells
  expressing PD-L1 were lower in age matched cancer patients than in healthy donors (figure 3K). The assays described
  here could thus be employed to study any adverse effects that chemotherapy, steroids, or other agents may have on
  cancer patients being exposed to SARS-CoV-2. This assay has also been used to study the effects of various immune
  modulators and other so-called “non-immune‒based therapeutics” on the immune system of cancer patients in clinical
  trials. It should be pointed out that analyses of specific immune cells in the blood compartment may not reflect their
  presence in different tissue compartments such as lymph nodes and sites of viral infection, since immune responses can
  shift from one compartment to another. The timing of such shifts should also be considered. In this case, analyses of
  the peripheral immunome, with the ability to obtain blood samples at multiple time points during infection and
  convalescence, may help in the understanding of the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2. It is thus suggested that this and
  similar assays be employed in clinical studies of patients with COVID-19 to help determine (a) which individuals or
  groups are most susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, (b) which individuals will have inapparent or mild versus severe
  disease, (c) the effects of vaccines or therapeutic agents on the immune system of individuals/patients, (d) the
  durability of response to vaccination and to whether there is a need for revaccination, (e) the relationship of
  antibody response vs. cellular immune response post‒SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and/or convalescence post-infection, and
  (f) the mechanisms involved in SARS-CoV-2 viral clearance<strong> </strong>and of convalescence of severe infections.
</p>
<p><strong>SOLUBLE FACTORS</strong></p>
<p>The mainstay of analyses of immune responses of patients with COVID-19 will be detection of SARS-CoV-2 virus or viral
  RNA, and the detection of anti-viral antibody responses. Other soluble factors that should be analyzed in a
  comprehensive manner are the spectrum of cytokines and chemokines from sera or plasma. There are other soluble
  factors, however, detected in sera or plasma that may also aid in defining immune responses to SARS-CoV-2; these
  include the detection of soluble (s) CD27, sCD40L, sPD-L1, sPD-1 and soluble granzyme; these assays are being used to
  monitor patients’ responses in various cancer immunotherapy trials. sCD27, for example, is preferentially derived from
  activated CD4+ T cells, and greater levels are seen in apparently healthy individuals versus cancer patients.<sup>21
    31</sup> Some studies have shown that immunotherapy can increase sCD27 in sera.<sup>31</sup> sCD40L is a functional
  trimer that is shed from activated T lymphocytes and more likely from platelets, and has also been investigated in
  autoimmune disease.<sup>32</sup> Evidence has been provided that higher levels of sCD40L are seen in some cancer
  patients and that this may have an immunosuppressive effect.<sup>33</sup> Studies have also shown that the ratio of
  sCD27:sCD40L may be indicative of a therapeutic benefit.<sup>17</sup></p>
<p>These soluble factors are already proving to be important biomarkers in COVID-19, reflecting the need to develop
  effective antiviral immunity without tipping the balance towards toxic inflammation. An investigation of soluble
  checkpoints in patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection found that increased baseline levels of sIDO, s4-1BB,
  sTIM-3, and</p>
<p>sCD27 were associated with higher disease severity rates and longer ICU stays.<sup>34</sup> This may reflect complex
  dysregulation of the T-cell responses needed to overcome SARS-CoV-2 infection through a combination of hyperactivation
  followed by exhaustion.<sup>28</sup> A study of inflammatory cytokines in over 1400 hospitalized patients found
  initial levels of both IL-6 and TNF-α to be independent predictors of disease severity and mortality.<sup>35</sup>
  While elevated sCD40L may be associated with immunosuppression and possible impairment of antiviral responses, CD40L
  is also critical in humoral immunity.<sup>36</sup> In that context, lower levels may negatively impact antiviral
  antibody responses. Further investigation of these soluble factors on both humoral and cellular immune responses may
  provide further predictive biomarkers as well as insights for vaccine and therapeutic development.</p>
<p><strong>EFFECT OF STEROIDS ON IMMUNE SUBSETS</strong></p>
<p>One of the consequences of cancer immunotherapy, especially the use of checkpoint inhibitor MAbs, is the induction of
  immune-related adverse events in some patients. These patients are often treated with corticosteroids such as
  dexamethasone or prednisone. Naïve lymphocytes are typically most susceptible to glucocorticoid effects with increases
  in the neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) caused by both a rapid decrease in lymphocytes and a later sustained
  increase in neutrophils.<sup>37</sup> Figure 4 shows the effects on various immune subsets of cancer patients treated
  with corticosteroids. As seen in Figure 4A, there is little effect on CD8+ T cells but profound effects involving
  decreases in CD4+ T cells and Tregs, as well as on cDCs in most patients (figure 4B-D); on the other hand, one
  observed an increase in B cells and MDSCs post-steroid treatment (figure 4E,F). Examples of changes seen in the more
  refined immune subsets are seen in Figure 4G-J. This effect of corticosteroids is further exemplified in three
  patients receiving the anti-PDL1 MAb avelumab. The increase in MDSCs and simultaneous decrease in Tregs is seen
  post-steroid treatment (figure 5A). Additional changes in T-cell diversity are also observed post-steroid treatment
  with increases in T-cell clonality seen in all three patients evaluated (figure 5B). </p>
<p>These lymphocyte subset changes induced by corticosteroids may also be relevant to patients with COVID-19. Patients
  with COVID-19 who have an elevated NLR have a worse prognosis.<sup>38</sup> While glucocorticoids can improve survival
  in patients who require respiratory support due to the severe inflammation caused by the SARS-CoV2 virus, their use
  earlier on in viral infections may be counterproductive.<sup>39-41</sup> In addition, CD4 help is required for
  antibody responses to coronavirus infections thus the decreases in CD4+ T cells caused by glucocorticoid use could be
  counterproductive early on in the disease. Furthermore, high doses of corticosteroids are associated with prolonged
  viral shedding and decreased clearance of SARS-CoV2.<sup>42</sup></p>
<p><strong>PERSPECTIVE</strong></p>
<p class="plain-text">The multiple compartments of the adaptive and innate cellular immunome should be interrogated to
  help define which patients may benefit most from preventive SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and in determining which factors
  better define the severity of both primary and secondary infections with SARS-CoV-2. Thus, in addition to the
  development of preventive vaccines primarily designed to induce antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, emphasis
  should be placed on vaccines designed to also enhance cellular immune responses; these cellular immune responses
  should not only be directed to the spike protein, but also to internal components of the SARS-CoV-2 virion. The
  nucleocapsid N protein of SARS-CoV-2 may well be more highly conserved than the spike protein; this may be of
  importance in limiting the severity of primary and secondary infections if SARS-CoV-2 variants in the spike proteins
  arise. The cell-based and soluble factor assays described here may also be employed in the analysis of the effects of
  various antivirals and other potential anti‒SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics on the cellular immunome, and in the study of the
  pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infections.</p>

  different between healthy donors under and over age 40. (D-I) Representative graphs are shown for notable refined
  subsets related to activation and maturation, with differences between healthy donors under and over the age of 40
  indicated. Graphs display median frequency as a percentage of PBMCs with 25-75 percentiles. Differences were defined
  by an adjusted p&lt;0.05, the median of groups showing a &gt;50% difference, and a frequency above 0.01% of PBMCs. P
  value was calculated using the Mann-Whitney test and with Holm adjustment made for multiple comparisons using the
  number of standard immune cell types with a frequency above 0.01% of PBMCs (n=9). For refined subsets, Holm adjustment
  was made using the number of subsets within each standard subset with a frequency above 0.01% of PBMCs (n=29 for CD4+
  T cells, 25 for CD8T+ cells, 5 for regulatory T cells (Tregs), 14 for natural killer (NK) cells, 3 for NKT cells, 4

<p><strong>Figure 4 </strong>Change in standard parental immune cell types and refined subsets after
  corticosteroids.<strong> </strong>Cancer patients (n=11) enrolled in immunotherapy trials received moderate-to
  high-dose corticosteroids (prednisone, n=6; methylprednisolone and prednisone, (n=4); or dexamethasone,
  methylprednisolone, and prednisone, n=1) for the development of immune related adverse events. (A-F) Changes in
  standard parental immune cell types after corticosteroids. (G-J) Representative graphs are shown for notable refined
  subsets that changed with corticosteroids. Significant changes were defined by a p value &lt;0.05, a median difference
  post- vs pre-steroids &gt;0.05% of PBMCs, and at least half of evaluated patients having a &gt;25% change. The panels
  used for refined subsets reflecting maturation/functional status of subsets were slightly different for the various
  immunotherapy trials, so certain subsets were not tested in all patients (n=6 for Treg CD38 and non-classical
  monocytes). </p>

  clinical responders who developed autoimmune adverse events and were treated with corticosteroids. Dashed line denotes
  timing of steroids and solid line indicates time of clinical response. (B) TCR diversity (measured by the metric of
  repertoire size) as reduced after corticosteroids; values indicate the number of individual clonotypes comprising the
